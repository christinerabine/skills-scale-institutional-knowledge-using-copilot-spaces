# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (include all relevant roles: PM, PdM, Developers, BA, UX/UI, DevOps, QA, Support as needed)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

## Cross-functional Planning Considerations
- **Business Analysts** document requirements and user stories during backlog creation
- **UX/UI Designers** create design specifications and ensure designs are ready before implementation
- **DevOps Engineers** identify infrastructure needs, deployment dependencies, and CI/CD requirements
- **QA/Testing** defines test strategy, acceptance criteria, and quality gates
- **Support/Customer Success** provides input on customer needs and documentation requirements
- Use the [Process Ownership Matrix](octoacme-process-ownership-matrix.md) to assign clear accountability

## Backlog Item Template

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
